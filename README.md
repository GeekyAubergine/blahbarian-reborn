# blahbarian-reborn

A work in progress re-build of a previous [hackathon](https://zoeaubert.me/blog/hack-pompey-2023/) project. You can play the [old version](https://zoeaubert.me/projects/blahbarian-hackathon/). [Code](https://github.com/GeekyAubergine/blahbarian) is available on GitHub.

This is both an experiment in building a game completely myself and a way to learn [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

I will eventually put this on my website, but for now you'll have to download it and compile it yourself. It's Rust ðŸ¦€ so it shouldn't be too hard. Though I think I'm relying on nightly features so you'll need to use that.
