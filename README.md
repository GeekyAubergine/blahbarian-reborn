# blahbarian-reborn

A work in progress re-build of a previous hackathon project, [Barbarian](https://github.com/GeekyAubergine/blahbarian). You can play the [old version](https://zoeaubert.me/projects/blahbarian-hackathon/).

This is both an experiment in building a game completely myself and a way to learn [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
